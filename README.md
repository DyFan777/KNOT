# KNOT
Knowing Nothing Outside Tracking

A single particle tracking method that does not inherently bias particle localization or motion with a global model.

The manuscript is currently in preparation for the Journal of Physical Chemistry A. We will post a link to the article once it is published.


Shout out to Logan D.C. Bishop for his work with pyTroika, which kickstarted this whole project. An interface between pyTroika and KNOT is in the works.

Shout out to Chayan Dutta for designing the instrument to take experimental data, as well as his help in testing and troubleshooting.

Shout out to Suparna Sarkar-Banerjee for her work in cellular microscopy, providing a biological testing ground for KNOT.
