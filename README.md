# KNOT
Knowing Nothing Outside Tracking

A single particle tracking method that does not inherently bias particle localization or motion with a global model.

The manuscript is currently in the submission process for the Journal of Physical Chemistry A. We will post a link to the article once it is published.

An instructional video can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cFKy2c1eynYgnlCxDtpeQ-IDxbCUJYEW/view?usp=sharing
It will soon be uploaded to YouTube.

Thank you to Logan D.C. Bishop for his work with pyTroika, which kickstarted this whole project. An interface between pyTroika and KNOT is in the works.

Thank you to Chayan Dutta for designing the instrument to take experimental data, as well as his help in testing and troubleshooting.

Thank you to Suparna Sarkar-Banerjee for her work in cellular microscopy, providing a biological testing ground for KNOT.

Thank you to Wesley Leung for providing sample data and all his help testing and troubleshooting.
